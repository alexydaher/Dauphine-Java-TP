TP1 : OOP essentials

Exercice 1:

2- sysout : system.out.println();

3- tostr : generates toString() method

4- main: generates main() method

5-  - generates constructor for the class
- generates setFoo() method

6- Refactors the name of the class or the field


Exercice 2:

1- All int variables are set to 0 by default

2- We can’t access the x and y fields because of ‘private’ , we can fix it by adding getter methods for each field.

3- To protect our fields.

4- An accessor is the getter method we can call to get the value of a private field. Yes we have to do it here to access the fields from the other class

6- We need to use ‘this.x = x’ and ‘this.y = y’.

7-  We should add a static field (numberOfPoints) initialised at 0 and incremented everytime we create a new point

8- The compiler knows which constructor to use based on the parameter passed while calling the constructor method.

Exercice 3:

1- true
   false
because ‘==’ compares the adress of each value and can return false even if the values are the same.

3- indexOf uses ‘==’ to find the right index of the parameter and that’s why it didn’t find the point p3.

Exercice 4:

2- We will have an index out of bounds error.

5- We have an error 'Cannot invoke "Object.equals(Object)" because "e" is null'

Exercice 5:
5- When changing the center of the 'c2' it changes also the center of 'c'

6- If we return the center then we will have the same problem as the previous question

Exercice 6:

4- It prints the toString method of the circle class
